# Intro to for Loops
Examine the code and run the program to see how it functions.

Modify the `for` loop to display the first name 5 times instead of 10 times. Additionally, each time the name is printed, put a number starting with 1 at the beginning of the line and have the number incremented each loop.

Sample run:
	
	Please input your first name
	Hector
	1 Hector
	2 Hector
	3 Hector
	4 Hector
	5 Hector
